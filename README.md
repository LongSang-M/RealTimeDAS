# RealTimeDAS
This is the package that do real-time blind denoising for Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) Data with unsupervised deep learning. It includes the report, a real-time demonstration videos and a 10 minutes denoised and microseismic detection results from FORGE Data.
There is 3 main notebook or python script which you could restimulate the things:  
1. Onlyretrain.py, where you can retrain your data based on different hyperparamteter settings with FORGE Data.
2. onlyplot.ipynb, where you can view your model results (training and validation loss, denoised results etc)
3. Run_script_FORGE_Detection.py, where you can run the denoised results and do microseismic detections with STA/LTA.
